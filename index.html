<h1>Threax Personal Cloud</h1>
<p>The Threax Personal Cloud is a series of apps with centralized identity management that can be deployed in your home. I have created apps for home automation, note taking, file management, shopping lists and budgeting. These apps are written in Asp.Net Core using the Threax Hypermedia Framework. These pages will show how to setup a server and will give an overview of each app.</p>
