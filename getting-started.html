<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>To get started using these apps you will need a few things. I hope to make this process easier in the future, but if you consider yourself adventerous you should give these steps a try. You will register a domain, setup a Linux server and then start cloning and building the software.</p>
<h2>Get a Domain</h2>
<p>The first step should be to get a domain. You can use any registrar you want, but don&#39;t pay much more than $10 per year and domains can be even cheaper than that. I reccomend using a registrar that supports dynamic dns so you can setup a vpn back to your network.</p>
<h2>Get SSL Certificates Using Let&#39;s Encrypt</h2>
<p>You can also buy a SSL certificate from your registrar, but I reccomend using free ones from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#39;s Encrypt</a>. The apps&nbsp;are designed to work best with SSL and this is the only supported configuration. The specific steps to get a certificate will be included on the server setup page.</p>
<h2>Make Sure Your Router is Up to the Task</h2>
<p>You will need to have a router that supports custom DNS. Ideally it will also have vpn capabilities so you can connect back to your apps from outside of your home. <a href="https://www.untangle.com/">Untangle</a> is a good option if you have a spare pc with multiple network cards. It supports dynamic dns so you can find your&nbsp;router outside your network. You can customize the DNS entries for your local network to register your apps and you can setup OpenVPN to connect to your network from outside. All of this is powered by a nice UI and you can setup automatic updates to keep everything working smoothly.</p>
<h2>Get a PC</h2>
<p>These apps are pretty flexible in how you deploy them, but the reccomended configuration is to use Linux on a spare x86 (Intel or AMD) PC. In the future I want to try to support hardware like a Raspberry Pi, but in all honesty by the time you configure one of those fully you are pretty much in cheap PC territory price wise. There is still a great deal of momentum in the x86 space and you will have a easier time with this type of computer vs one of the newer SBCs (Single Board Computers). These are, however, very cool and if you want to use one by all means give it a try.</p>
<p>If you have an old computer sitting around that might be a good place to start. Just note that if you are going to use something like an old laptop make sure it has <span class="zci__def__word text--primary">adequate</span> cooling. You will probably run this machine 24/7 and you don&#39;t want it to die from heat. A virtual machine running on a box you use for something else will also work well. If you just want to run the apps on your gaming rig and leave it on that can work too. Ideally though you will have an isolated environment and the best option is a separate power sipping mini desktop with good fans.</p>
<p>These are the individual components that you will need. You can swap out any of the reccomendations if you have your own preferences. The next step will be to configure your server and begin installing the apps.</p>
